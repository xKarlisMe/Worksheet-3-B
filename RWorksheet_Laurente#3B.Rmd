## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#1.) 
#b.) Every respondent are asked different questions regarding their Sex, Father's Occupation, Persons at Home, Siblings at School, and Types of Houses. While numeric answers align and are appropriate for the other questions, some questions assigned pre-determined legends or assignments to the numbers so that their numeric answer should correspond to its assigned assignment. In this case, Sex, Father's Occupation, and Types of Houses are questions that are normally not answerable by numeric values but since the authors of the survey assigned examples or legends to the numbers, they are now acceptable answers.
